# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

# How does Profile.js Work and its components? 

We have a couple of functions and each will be explained below:


# Errors and Fixes:

## Error 1 (react-refresh):

```shell
Compiled with problems:
Ã—
ERROR in ./src/App.js 1:40-111
Module not found: Error: You attempted to import /Users/hadibishr/Theki/node_modules/react-refresh/runtime.js which falls outside of the project src/ directory. Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported.
You can either move it inside src/, or add a symlink to it from project's node_modules/.
```

### Fix: 

To fix thix this you have to remove react-refresh from devDeps in package.json. And possibly also craco.config.js.
