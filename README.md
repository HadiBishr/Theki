# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

# List of commands to run the whole project (Run in order for 1-4)

## (Make sure you are in the Theki directory, if not then run "cd Theki")
## 1. npx hardhat node
## 2. npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
## 3. npm start
## 4. python app.py

# How does Profile.js Work and its components? 

We have a couple of functions and each will be explained below:


## handleAddItem 

{explain it here}


## {the other functions and so on}
